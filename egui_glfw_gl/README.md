This is a backend implementation for [Egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) that can be used with Rust bindings for [GLFW](https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/glfw-rs) and [OpenGL](https://github.com/brendanzab/gl-rs).

## Example
I have made an example to demonstrate the usage of egui_glfw_gl. To run the example, run the following:
```
cargo run --example demo
```
